# Friend Finder

## What do we have here?
This is an app that helps you find a friend or in this case a disney princess by matching you based on survey questions.

## How does it work?
Complete the survey. Select a response for each question based on if you strongly disagree to strongly agree. Friend finder compares each question response to all database friends' (princesses') responses. Once the survey is complete, Friend Finder will display the friend (princess) with the closest responses to your answers.
